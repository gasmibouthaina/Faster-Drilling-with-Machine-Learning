How to find the sweet spot to optimize ROP in drilling ?

A drill string is unity or assembly that consists of components shown in the schematic below. 

The weight provided by the drill collar (thick-walled tubular pieces made of steel bars) is in direct interface with the drill bit. 


This weight is called the Weight On Bit or WOB, defined as the downward force exerted to the drill bit needed to break the rock. 

Since the drill bit is rotating, the Rotation Per Minute or RPM is measured.

Dataset

The dataset that we are going to use is arranged from two original data; 

real-time drilling data and a Computed Petrophysical Output (CPO) log data from well number 15/9-F-15 in the Volve Oil Field in the North Sea

we will use in this Project :

           The dataset consists of 8 columns

           visualized into a log display where we can observe how the drilling parameters and petrophysical properties of the reservoir change over depth.

           causes the ROP to suddenly drop at depth 3,480 m
 
           values of WOB and RPM are needed to optimize the ROP
 
           Gradient Boosting Machine for ROP prediction or GBM
 
           Optimization with Particle Swarm Which resulted in the prediction space
